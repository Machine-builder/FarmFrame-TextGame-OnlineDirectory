Just a game I'm making for fun ;)

Text based gathering game! :)
Craft items & gather resources.

Craft new crafters!? ;)

# releases :

 > First tests of updating! :)
 
* version 1:
 > Bug fixes
 
* version 2:

* version 3:
>What's new in update 3:
 
>Work on something called a 'community chest'
where players everywhere (all around the world)
can put items & take items from.
Do not put items in the community chest if you
do want the item. Someone probably will take it...
COMMUNITY CHEST IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR USERS
WHO DOWNLOADED THE GAME FROM GITHUB!   
I AM ONLY GIVING THE COMMUNITY CHEST ADDON
TO PEOPLE I KNOW AND TRUST.   
THE COMMUNITY CHEST ADDON HAS PRIVATE CREDENTIALS
& THUS I CANNOT SHARE IT ON GITHUB FOR SAFETY REASONS.
SORRY :/

delivered to your inventory!)
 
>ADDED A WIKI!
Lookup your items to see how to make them/
what they are/do!

* version 4:
>If you download the game from
GitHub you can now ACTUALLY run it :)
