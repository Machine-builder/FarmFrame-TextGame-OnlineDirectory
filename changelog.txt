 What's new in update 3??
 
 - Work on something called a 'community chest'
   where players everywhere (all around the world)
   can put items & take items from.
   Do not put items in the community chest if you
   do want the item. Someone probably will take it...
   COMMUNITY CHEST IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR USERS
   WHO DOWNLOADED THE GAME FROM GITHUB!   
   I AM ONLY GIVING THE COMMUNITY CHEST ADDON
   TO PEOPLE I KNOW AND TRUST.   
   THE COMMUNITY CHEST ADDON HAS PRIVATE CREDENTIALS
   & THUS I CANNOT SHARE IT ON GITHUB FOR SAFETY REASONS.
   SORRY :/
   
 - Added batteries!?
 
 - Started work on Automation!
   (automatically get wood/rocks
   delivered to your inventory!)
 
 - ADDED A WIKI!
   Lookup your items to see how to make them/
   what they are/do!
   
 - Bug fixes... :)
